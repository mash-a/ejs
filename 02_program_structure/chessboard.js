/*
Write a program that creates a string that represents an 8Ã—8 grid, using newline characters to separate lines. At each position of the grid there is either a space or a "#" character. The characters should form a chessboard.

Passing this string to console.log should show something like this:

 # # # #
# # # # 
 # # # #
# # # # 
 # # # #
# # # # 
 # # # #
# # # #
When you have a program that generates this pattern, define a binding size = 8 and change the program so that it works for any size, outputting a grid of the given width and height. 
*/

const chessboard = (n = 8) => {
  let board = "";
  let nextChar = "#";
  let lastChar = " ";
  let line = "";
  for (let i = 0; i < n; i++) {
    for (let j = 0; j < n; j++) {
      if (j % 2 === 0) {
        line += nextChar;
      } else {
        line += lastChar;
      }
    }
    nextChar = nextChar === "#" ? " " : "#";
    lastChar = lastChar === "#" ? " " : "#";
    if (i < n - 1) {
      board += line + "\n";
    } else {
      board += line;
    }
    line = "";
  }
  console.log(board);
